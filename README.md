# Supply-Chain-Greenhouse-Gas-Emission
 As businesses and industries move toward sustainability, understanding and reducing carbon footprints across the supply chain has become a priority.
Through data analysis, we can uncover emission patterns, identify high-impact areas, and develop actionable strategies to support environmental sustainability.

By leveraging Microsoft Excel, I analyzed these emissions to gain insights into the environmental impact of supply chain operations.

Key Findings from the Analysis
Using Excel’s data cleaning, pivot tables, and visualization tools, I extracted meaningful insights, including:
- Top 10 industries with Emission factors without margins.
- Top 6 industries with Emission Factors with margins.
- ⁠Margin of supply chain Emission Factors. 
- ⁠Top 5 Reference code with margin.
- ⁠Top 10 industries with Avg Supply Chain Emission Factors with Margins. 
- ⁠Top 10 Industries with Avg of Supply Chain Emission Factors without Margins.

Conclusion
This analysis highlights the critical role of data-driven decision-making in supply chain sustainability. By leveraging Microsoft Excel’s capabilities, organizations can measure, track, and reduce emissions effectively.

As we move toward a greener future, I encourage businesses to integrate sustainability-focused data analysis into their supply chain strategies. Together, we can make informed decisions that benefit both the environment and long-term business growth.
